# Team Project for Java Course at University

This project was a collaborative effort for a Java course at university.

## Backend Development
I primarily worked on the back-end components involving authentication, including:
- **Sign-up** functionality
- **Email verification** for user registration
- **JWT-based authentication** via Spring Security
- Managing the **Security Context**

The system also features **role-based authorization** with two main roles:
- **Regular users**
- **Administrators**

Additionally, I implemented several security features such as:
- **Email confirmation** required to complete the registration process.
- **Auto-locking accounts** after a certain number of failed login attempts.
- **User banning** for violating platform rules.

## Other Backend Features
I contributed to the **Controller**, **Service**, and **Repository** layers for various features, including:
- Ratings
- In-system messaging
- User and profile pages
- Profile settings
- And more.

## Frontend Development
I was also responsible for the majority of the front-end development, utilizing **vanilla React.js** to create a responsive and interactive user experience. This included handling user inputs, integrating with back-end services, and ensuring seamless navigation and UI transitions.
