I primarily worked on back-end components involving authentication, including sign-up, email verification, JWT-based authentication via Spring Security, and managing the Security Context. Additionally, I contributed to the Controller, Service, and Repository layers for various features, such as:

Ratings,
In-system messaging,
User and profile pages,
Profile settings, and more.
I was also responsible for most of the front-end development using vanilla React.js.
